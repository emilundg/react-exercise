## Functions
A function is a block of statements that can be executed as often as you like. A function can have parameters and can return a value. Functions can be defined in different ways. Perhaps the most common one is the function declaration. It starts with the keyword function. It follows:

    the name of the function,
    the parameters enclosed in round parentheses,
    the statements enclosed in curly brackets.

With the keyword return a value can be returned. At the same time return terminates the function. Statements after a return will not be executed.

1. Define a function hello that returns 'Hello world!'.
2. Assign a variable in main.js "let result = hello()" and print result.
